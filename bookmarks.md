<p>Bookmarks are your saved items or fragments, they constitute your "corpus".</p>
<h3>Bookmarks</h3>
<p>Bookmarks are selections made by the users of the Media Suite. After querying the available collections, the items in the result list can be saved (e.g., television programs, films, letters, oral history interviews, newspaper articles, among others). The Media Suite supports users in making these selections, since we consider them important for corpus creation. Users can find these bookmarks in their Workspace, and order them (e.g., by creating "bookmark groups"). </p>
<p>The metadata (not the items themselves) of the resulting bookmark lists can be searched, sorted, filtered, and exported using the Workspace functionalities.</p>
