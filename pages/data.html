                        The Media Suite offers access to data (metadata and, in most cases, to the content itself, i.e.,
                        to the media objects) of important audio-visual and related contextual collections held by
                        cultural institutions in The Netherlands. To get access to the data, please follow these steps:

                            <li>For researchers/end users of the Data services of the CLARIAH Media Suite</li>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Open CKAN by using the "Visit CKAN" button at the end of the <a
                                        href="http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/data">Data page of the Media Suite</a>. You
                                    will be redirected to an external service, the Media Suite instance in the <a
                                            href="http://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/dataset">CKAN registration
                                        software</a>.
                                <li> In that page, you can see the datasets that are registered (made available) in the
                                    Media Suite. You can search registered datasets by using tags (thematic, media
                                    types), organizations (creators of the datasets or collections), or groups (groups
                                    are used to organise datasets by data provider). Please be aware that these tags,
                                    organizations and groups refer to the "dataset level", not to the content itself.
                                <li> If you want to search (or view) the content of the datasets, go to the "Tools"
                                    section of the Media Suite. You will find a "Collection selector" in each tool,
                                    which will give you the list of available/registered collections that you can see in
                                    CKAN.
                            </ol>
                            <li> Registering your own datasets is not supported yet.
                            <li> For curators/data owners: The current instance of CKAN implemented for the CLARIAH
                                media studies focus includes datasets that we have registered (by harvesting or
                                importing them) on behalf of the collection owners. In the near future, more
                                organisations can register their collections and add data themselves. Registration with
                                an open licence is possible, but private access is also an option. The data itself can
                                be added to each registered collection using different formats (e.g., XML, JSON, RDF).
                            <li> Note: CLARIAH also offers other data registration services (see <a
                                    href="https://www.clariah.nl/files/wp/wp2_anansi_project_brief.pdf">Anansi
                                information</a>; <a href="https://vimeo.com/186090384">Anansi video</a>). Aligning these
                                services is work in progress.
