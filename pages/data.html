                    The Media Suite offers access to data (metadata and, in most cases, to the content itself, i.e.,
                    to the media objects) of important audio-visual and related contextual collections held by
                    cultural institutions in The Netherlands. To get access to the data, please follow these steps:

                        <li>For researchers/end users of the Data services of the CLARIAH Media Suite</li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Open CKAN by using the "Visit CKAN" button at the end of the <a
                                    href="http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/data">Data page of the Media Suite</a>. You
                                will be redirected to an external service, the Media Suite instance in the <a
                                        href="http://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/dataset">CKAN registration
                                    software</a>.
                            <li> In that page, you can see the datasets that are registered (made available) in the
                                Media Suite. You can search registered datasets by using tags (thematic, media
                                types), organizations (creators of the datasets or collections), or groups (groups
                                are used to organise datasets by data provider). Please be aware that these tags,
                                organizations and groups refer to the "dataset level", not to the content itself.
                            <li> If you want to search (or view) the content of the datasets, go to the "Tools"
                                section of the Media Suite. You will find a "Collection selector" in each tool,
                                which will give you the list of available/registered collections that you can see in
                                CKAN.
                        </ol>
                        <li> Registering your own datasets is not supported yet.
                        <li> For curators/data owners: The current instance of CKAN implemented for the CLARIAH
                            media studies focus includes datasets that we have registered (by harvesting or
                            importing them) on behalf of the collection owners. In the near future, more
                            organisations can register their collections and add data themselves. Registration with
                            an open licence is possible, but private access is also an option. The data itself can
                            be added to each registered collection using different formats (e.g., XML, JSON, RDF).
                        <li> Note: CLARIAH also offers other data registration services (see <a
                                href="https://www.clariah.nl/files/wp/wp2_anansi_project_brief.pdf">Anansi
                            information</a>; <a href="https://vimeo.com/186090384">Anansi video</a>). Aligning these
                            services is work in progress.
