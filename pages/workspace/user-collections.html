<p>The User Collections are your own media files.</p>
<h3>User Collections</h3>
<p>The Media Suite offers Automatic Speech Recognition services (ASR) for Dutch audio-visual materials. Version 3 includes ASR enrichments for an important part of the audio-visual collection of The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision. Also in Version 3, users can, for the first time in the Media Suite, upload their own materials and run the ASR service themselves, getting as output ASR transcripts. Their "personal collections" can be searched using the same functionalities that the Media Suite offers for other collections. </p>
