                        <li><b>What is the Media Suite?</b></li>
                        The Media Suite is a research environment within the Dutch infrastructure for digital humanities
                        and social sciences (CLARIAH) which aims to serve the needs of scholars for working with
                        audiovisual data collections and related multi-media contextual sources that are maintained at
                        cultural heritage institutions and knowledge institutions.
                        <br><br>
                        <li><b>How can I access the Media Suite?</b></li>
                        Any researcher with a valid university or research institution account in The Netherlands can
                        access the data, tools and workspace offered by The Media Suite. These aspects have to be taken
                        into account:
                        <ul id="id02">
                            <li> The university or research institution to which the researcher belongs to has to be
                                connected with <b>SURFconext</b> (most institutions are), and also, has to connect to
                                the <b>CLARIN service</b> (that the Media Suite belongs to) in the local SURFconext
                                settings of the institution. When you are prompted to the login page of The Media Suite,
                                search for your institution in the search box. If your institute is not listed in the
                                Media Suite, you have to ask your local ICT helpdesk to make this connection. Every
                                institution has one or more SURFcontext maintainers/responsibles who should be able to
                                do this for you.
                            <li> If a non-dutch institution wants to have access to the Media Suite: This is currently
                                not possible in Media Suite version 2.
                            <li> If a Dutch non-academic individual (or non-Dutch academics) want to have access to the
                                Media Suite: this is currently not possible in Media Suite version 2.
                                <br>
                                Note: In Version 2 users have to log in to use the tools. In Version 3 of the Media
                                Suite (expected release in April 2018, or in partial preliminary release) we will
                                implement a different logic for accessing (restricted) parts. When this is in place, no
                                login will be needed to use the tools nor the non-restricted data sets either.

                        <li><b>How does the CLARIAH Media Suite work?</b></li>
                        The Media Suite offers the three main services, which are explained below: Data (collections,
                        datasets); Tools (search, data analysis & visualization functionalities); Workspace (personal
                        and collaborative functionalities).
                        <br><br>
                        <li><b>How has the Media Suite been built?</b></li>
                        The Media Suite is built based on a co-development approach. The collaboration between scholars
                        and software engineers takes place in the context of the <a
                            href="https://clariah.nl/projecten/research-pilots">CLARIAH Research pilot projects</a>.
                        Since the beginning of the project, the CLARIAH Media Suite is being co-developed with media
                        scholars, oral historians, and other scholars who use audio-visual media intensively. The Media
                        Suite is also inspired in in prior prototypes, such as AVResearcherXL, Comerda, DIVE and TROVE.
                        The Media Suite is constantly improved based on the input of the scholarly community. In its
                        current version it is, and does not intend, to be a complete or finished product.
                        <br><br>
                        <li><b>Where is the Media Suite hosted?</b></li>
                        It is hosted at the The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision (NISV) that acts as a CLARIAH
                        centre. All tools and components developed within CLARIAH are open source, the Media Suite code
                        is available in the <a href="https://github.com/CLARIAH">CLARIAH GitHub repository page</a>.

                    <div><h1 class="anchor">2. Data</h1>
                        The Media Suite offers access to data (metadata and, in most cases, to the content itself, i.e.,
                        to the media objects) of important audio-visual and related contextual collections held by
                        cultural institutions in The Netherlands. To get access to the data, please follow these steps:

                                    will be redirected to an external service, the Media Suite instance in the <a

                                    Media Suite. You can search registered datasets by using tags (thematic, media
                                    types), organizations (creators of the datasets or collections), or groups (groups
                                    are used to organise datasets by data provider). Please be aware that these tags,
                                    organizations and groups refer to the "dataset level", not to the content itself.
                                <li> If you want to search (or view) the content of the datasets, go to the "Tools"
                                    section of the Media Suite. You will find a "Collection selector" in each tool,
                                    which will give you the list of available/registered collections that you can see in
                                    CKAN.

                                media studies focus includes datasets that we have registered (by harvesting or
                                importing them) on behalf of the collection owners. In the near future, more
                                organisations can register their collections and add data themselves. Registration with
                                an open licence is possible, but private access is also an option. The data itself can
                                be added to each registered collection using different formats (e.g., XML, JSON, RDF).
                            <li> Note: CLARIAH also offers other data registration services (see <a

                        <p>The functionalities offered by the Media Suite enable researchers to access (search, browse,
                            view) data/collections and perform tasks with them. These include: inspect the collection's
                            metadata structure and completness, browse, search, view the media objects (in most cases),
                            visualize patterns in the metadata, create personal collections (bookmarks), annotate media
                            items, export data.

                        <p>The "collection inspection" functionalities support the scholarly tasks of \"Data critique\"
                            by facilitating the close inspection of the metadata fields that constitute each collection.
                            This tool offers basic support to perform data analytics tasks on these metadata (e.g.,
                            detect incomplete data, or observe value distributions along date fields)". The purpose of
                            this tool is to provide an overview of how a collection/dataset is constituted and also to
                            allow a closer inspection of their metadata. It facilitates performing data analytics tasks
                            on their metadata (e.g., detect incomplete data, observe value distributions along date
                            fields), and sending the collection(s) to the other browsing and search recipes. It is
                            important to have clear that the collection inspector does not give search results! For this
                            purpose, the collections selected with this recipe have to be "sent" to the search
                            tools.</p>
