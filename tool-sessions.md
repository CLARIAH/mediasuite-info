<p>Tool sessions are "snapshots" of the state in which a tool was when you saved your session.</p>
<h3>Tool Sessions</h3>
<p>In this section of the Workspace you can access your saved "Tool sessions". At this moment (Version 3), the Media Suite only supports the storage of tool sessions from the "Explore/Browse" tool. Users can also "Save queries" via the Search tool.</p>
